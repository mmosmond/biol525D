- how to calculate p or Q in quality score? p is calculated from floursences (some formula with null expectation from known sequences)

- scaffold: can order contigs when have paired end data if one end in one contig and the other end in another contig (and you know roughly how many bps are between the two ends)

- can use IGV to view bam files (stacks reads against reference and highlights SNPs); better than samtools -tview
- check that all vcf files have an associated idx file before going on to the next step (realignmenttargetcreator gatk) bceause sometimes gatk crashes and gives truncated vcf file. can tell because idx created after. rerun if gatk crashed (seems to do so randomly bcause of memory issues).

- pruning linked SNPs: <1000bp separation (bceause programs assumed unlinked)

- try running bash script on just a couple samples first
- try outputting at different points to make sure it works (have an exit after the output until know working). once it works remove exit and comment out output step. or (more fancy) you could have an if statement that says if output1 already exists then don't run that section of code and move onto next step. $ if [ ! -f output1 ]; then output; fi
- when have error try running with subset of data, slowly build up until find error (eg what input is messing it up)
